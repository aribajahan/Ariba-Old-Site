My world right now: Python, exploring APIs, product development, creating keto recipes & staying healthy. 

There’s so much to read and learn in this lifetime. Making lists are not helping. So, I’m holding myself accountable to these GOALS:

Do 2 projects a month. That is exactly how this blog came to be! This was a weekend project in April 2014.
Reading about 2 books/ month. Plan on sharing my list and learnings here.
Blog on a regular basis to share what I’m learning and doing.
I mainly think about food. But, I’ll try my best to share my other fascinations. No promises.

What I try to live by: Fear Less. Test Often. Learn Always.
